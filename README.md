# How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
I interpret user needs and implement them into a program by creating user stories using the format “As a {type of user} I want to {perform some task} so that I can {achieve some goal}”, and then prioritizing them in the Product Backlog. Creating user stories help me to interpret user needs and implement them into a program by allowing me to clearly understand the client's problem, wanted solution, and type of user who is affected by the problem and solution. 

# How do I approach developing programs?
I approach developing programs by first identifying which approach is best for the program based on its scope and the resources available for it. For example, I may consider using the waterfall approach for a small project where there are clear, defined, and fixed requirements. The agile approach is better suited for bigger, more complicated projects where many team members are required and the scope is less clear and defined. If the agile approach is used, I would want to incorporate the Scrum events, tools, and processes into my development work, such as the Sprint Planning, Daily Scrum meetings, Sprint Review, and Sprint Retrospective. 
  
# What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
Being a good team member in software development means knowing when to listen attentively to others and speak up when something does not feel right. It is someone who is both a team player and knows when to say "no".
